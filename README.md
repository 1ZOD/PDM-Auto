# PDM Auto V0.1
## Overview
The program consists of 1 executable file:

app.exe : responsible for starting the application

## Dependencies

Excel spreadsheet: the program was structured around a spreadsheet provided by the planning/sourcing sector that contains all the articles for each session.

## Proposed problem

The planning/sourcing sector carries out an activity on the PDM website that consists of taking a code from the global article and adding information such as factory "A" (Mother Factory), material way, Related Color Ways, among others,
this information is given in a format of choice (checkbox), finally the file is downloaded (pdf/excel) which contains all the necessary data to monitor the process with the factories, each worksheet can contain more than 500 codes, the user takes on average 2 weeks or more to get finish the activity.

## Auto PDM

The tool we developed helps the user to select the spreadsheet, login to the site, filter the articles, select the desired fields (user interference), and download, making the process faster and more practical.

## Additional functions

Filter : user can filter specific articles

Save login: the user can choose to remember his login or not

Start over: the user can restart the process from scratch

Skip Items: User can skip specific items

Progress: User can continue where they left off by closing the program

Auto rename: the application renames the download according to the respective article name

Dropped : the application ignores models classified as dropped (out of session)
